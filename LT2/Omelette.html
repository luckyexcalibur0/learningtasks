	<li>Salt and Pepper</li>

<h2> Methods</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Mix the eggs in any sort of bowl or jug you like (a pint glass works well!) with salt, pepper and herbs if desired. </li>
  <li>Heat the butter (or oil) in a reasonably large frying pan. </li>
  <li>Pour in the egg mixture slowly and swirl the pan a little to even it out. </li>
  <li>After 30 seconds or so the top should firm up, at this point add grated cheese if you like. </li>
  <li>Continue cooking a little until the cheese begins to melt, then fold the omelette in half with a bendy spatula </li>
  <li>If its nice and cooked on the bottom already then serve, otherwise, continue cooking on each side a little more! </li>
